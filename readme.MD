In the comments there were some ideas for future additions to the code,
so I did some of these, and some other stuff.

-Added sound affects
-Added increasing difficulty as the game progresses,
-Added a cool (?) background
-Filled in the Asteroids
-Added a shield that is effective in the beginning of each wave,
-Fixed bug where sometimes the Asteroids would spwan within the
immediate vicinity of the ship

I have not played the original Asteroids, and it possible these changes make
the implementation less authentic/
